# Calorie-Calculator-in-Django
This is a nice intermediate level project to master Django and Python.

## What is a Calorie Calculator?

”Health is wealth” Obviously, you have heard it a thousand times but as we grow older we often realize it’s true and this app provides an interesting way to get started with the very boring term “dieting” as we already know “FITNESS START WITH WHAT WE EAT”.

Let’s develop an interesting project – Calorie Calculator to record and estimate number of calories we need to consume daily. This app can also provide guidelines for gaining or losing weight.

## Project Prerequisites:- 
### To implement this app we will use :-
1.Basic concepts of Python
2.HTML
3.CSS
4.Bootstrap
5.Django framework

### To install required libraries, use pip installer from the command line:
(Django filters are used)
If pyhton 3 is installed used pip3 instead of pip.
> 1.pip install django 
> 2.pip install django-filters


## Final product
Below is the final GUI of Calorie Calculator Project
